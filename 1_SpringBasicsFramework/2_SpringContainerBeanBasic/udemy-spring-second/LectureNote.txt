This project includes learning about
1) Spring container
2) Bean scopes

 /*
         * Spring relies heavily on IoC inversion of control
         *
         *		~ the spring container helps to make this inversion of control
         *
         *		Create the objects + wire them together + manage their complete life cycle
         *          from creation to destruction + uses DI to manage components --> these are the spring beans !!!
         *
         *		instructions 	+ metadata --> 		the container creates the full application !!!
         *					  (XML, annotations)
         *
         *		Two containers:
         *		    1.) Spring BeanFactory container
         *		    2.) Spring ApplicationContext container INTERFACE --> basically it includes all the features
         *                  of BeanFactory so this is the standard way
         *
         *      For example: resolve textual information from a properties file + load beans + wire beans together
         *		    org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext
         */
