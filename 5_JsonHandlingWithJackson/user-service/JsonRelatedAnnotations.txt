@JsonIgnore

This annotation in Jackson is used to exclude a specific field from JSON serialization and deserialization.



@JsonIgnoreProperties

This annotation in Jackson is used to ignore specified fields during JSON serialization and deserialization — either when reading JSON into Java objects, or writing Java objects into JSON.



@JsonIgnoreProperties({"password", "ssn"})
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private String ssn;
}


@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)

This annotation in Jackson (used in Spring Boot and other Java frameworks) controls which properties are included during JSON serialization — especially useful for cleaning up JSON output by removing null or default values.



@JsonProperty

This annotation in Jackson is used to customize the name of a field in the JSON output or input. It works both for serialization (Java → JSON) and deserialization (JSON → Java).

Why to use this annotation:

Match a different naming convention (e.g., snake_case in JSON vs camelCase in Java)

Handle legacy APIs with fixed field names

Customize field names for clarity or localization



@JsonFormat

This annotation in Jackson is used to specify how values should be formatted during JSON serialization and deserialization — especially for dates, times, enums, and numbers.

public class Event {

    @JsonFormat(pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
    private LocalDateTime eventTime;
}
A common use-case is when we format dates in Spring Boot.
